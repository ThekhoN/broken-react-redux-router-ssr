This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

### Simple react quote app with redux, redux-thunk, react-router:

#### How to use:
* Clone the repository
* $ npm install //install dependencies
* npm run dev //init the app equivalent to npm run start
* npm run start //start ssr app - broken -_-
<br/>

## TODO
* implement server-side-rendering
* improve styles :)
